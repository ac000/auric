		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
			Auric is a tool for analysing financial data, from say
			accounts payable.
		</para>
		<para>
			It uses Benford's Law, to look at the regularity of
			first, second and third digits in amounts. It allows to
			set and display amounts within certain thresholds. It
			displays a histogram of values from &lt; 10 through to
			&gt; 1,000,000 going through powers of 10. It displays
			repeat values and repeat invoices. Finally, it displays
			a list of entities with their total spend and number of
			invoices.
		</para>
		<para>
			All of these can be viewed on a per entity basis.
		</para>

		<title>Getting Started</title>
		<para>
			Once auric is running, you are presented with the main
			application window. The first thing you need to do is
			load in some data. This data takes the form of a simple
			TAB separated text file. For details of the format of
			this, see the <emphasis>docs/tmpl.tab</emphasis> file
			from the source.
		</para>
		<para>
			Use the file selection dialog to choose the file to
			load.

	<chapter>
		<title>Benford's Law</title>
		<para>
			Benford's Law basically describes the distribution of
			digits in a number. E.g The number 1 appearing as the
			first digit of a number should happen about 30.1% of
			the time, with the first digit being a 9 occuring about
			4.5% of the time.
		</para>
		<para>
			For more details, see this wikipedia page:
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law
		</para>
		<para>
			In auric we look at the first three digits and have a
			tab for each, displaying the digit distribution. The
			display is split into two halves.
		</para>
		<para>
			The right hand side shows the distribution as a graph.
			It shows the distribution curve as predicted by
			Benford's Law in blue and the actual distribution curve
			of the given data in red.
		</para>
		<para>
			The left hand side shows the distribution details. Each
			row shows the digit being examined, the number of times
			that digit appears in the said location, that number of
			times as a percentage and the deviation from what was
			predicted by Benford's Law, negative for less, positive
			for more.
		</para>
		<para>
			Below that, we have some other statistics, most of
			which are self explanatory. The RSF is the Relative
			Size Factor. This is the maximum value divided by the
			second maximum value. This is to help find times when
			an unusually large invoice has gone through compared to
			the rest.

		<title>Centinals</title>
		<para>
			This tab, displays the number of values between certain
			thresholds. These thresholds can be configured via the
			preferences window.
		</para>
		<para>
			It displays the number and percentage for each
			threshold on the left hand side and on the right it
			displays this information as a pie chart.

		<title>Histogram</title>
		<para>
			This shows the distribution of values from &lt; 10
			through to &gt; 1,000,000 going through powers of 10.
		</para>
		<para>
			On the left hand side it displays the number and

		<title>Repeat Invoices</title>
		<para>
			This shows repeat invoices. Currently it just goes by
			the invoice number to detect duplicates.
		</para>
		<para>
			If there were any repeat invoices there would be one
			line per invoice. They would be grouped together by
			background colour.
		</para>
		<para>
			You are able to double click on any line, to get more
